  <h1>While we have you...</h1>
  <p>We have a favor to ask.  In recent days, news organizations have many labels thrown at us: Fake News, Dishonest, The Opposition Party to name a few. Our audience, on the other hand, tells us VPR is Trusted, Essential, and Independent. We have one more label to add to the mix: committed - more than ever - to serving our community in this new and dynamic environment.</p>
  <p>No one knows what the months and years ahead will bring. But VPR is committed to producing high quality, thoughtful journalism for all: you won't find a paywall on our content. Our goal will always be to pursue fact-based truth, fueled by the belief that a strong and free press serves the public interest and supports a healthy democracy.</p>

  <h1>VPR's public service begins with you. Support it.</h1>
